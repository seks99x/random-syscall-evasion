# random-syscall-evasion
üí° Educational Windows Defender Research Source code and lab experiments from my two-part blog series on Windows Defender detection and evasion techniques.

This repository demonstrates how Windows system calls, API hooking, and process injection are detected by Defender, and how different syscall invocation patterns (direct syscalls, random jumps, etc.) affect detection in a controlled lab environment.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: This project is for educational and research purposes only.
All tests were performed in an isolated lab to better understand how defensive technologies work.
Do not use this code for malicious activity.
